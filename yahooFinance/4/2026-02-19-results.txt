=== ANALYSIS ===

Main/Hero Image:
- Former President Donald Trump at a podium, in front of a large American flag backdrop
- Expression: Serious, stern, and somewhat concerned/contemplative — not smiling
- Paired with headline: "US trade deficit surges in December, capping volatile year under tariffs"

Secondary Imagery:
- Walmart worker in hard hat (tied to "modest beat, cautious outlook" story)

Market Ticker (visible on page):
- S&P 500: -0.14% (red)
- Dow 30: -0.21% (red)
- Nasdaq: -0.09% (red)
All major indices in the red.

Key Headlines:
- "US trade deficit surges in December, capping volatile year under tariffs" (NEGATIVE)
- "Trump says he will decide in next 10 days whether US strikes Iran" (NEGATIVE/RISK)
- "Walmart stock rises after modest beat, cautious outlook" (MIXED)
- "Walmart loses sales crown to Amazon despite record revenues" (NEGATIVE)
- "Carvana Falls as Higher Costs Trim Used-Car Seller's Profit" (NEGATIVE)
- "Deere Jumps as Tractor Maker Sees Upturn in Farm Economy" (POSITIVE)
- "Jobless claims fall more than expected as labor market stabilizes" (POSITIVE)
- "US Notches One of Its Biggest Annual Trade Deficits Since 1960" (NEGATIVE)

Overall Sentiment Analysis:
The page conveys a cautious-to-bearish sentiment. The hero image features a stern Trump 
expression alongside headlines about surging trade deficits and geopolitical tensions 
(potential Iran strikes). All three major US market indices are showing modest declines. 
Headlines skew negative/cautious with only a couple of positive data points.

RATING: 4/10 — Bearish/Cautious
Rationale: Serious/stern expression, red market indices, majority negative headlines 
focused on trade deficits, geopolitical risks, and cautious corporate outlooks.
