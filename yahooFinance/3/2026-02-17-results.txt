## Main Hero/Feature Photo Analysis

The large hero image shows a trading floor scene — likely the New York Stock Exchange or a similar trading venue. The primary subject is a middle-aged male trader in the foreground, wearing a dark jacket. His facial expression conveys concern, worry, and focused intensity — brow slightly furrowed, a serious demeanor consistent with watching markets decline. Behind him, trading screens display market data, and other figures are visible in the background, reinforcing the active trading floor environment.

The photo is paired with the headline: "Tech leads stocks lower with AI fears in focus." The subhead reads: "Wall Street is in the middle of an AI shake-up as a tech sell-off has now extended to a wide range of industries."

A secondary image shows a man at what appears to be the World Economic Forum podium/backdrop, tied to a headline about "software stock bulls making a 'potentially fatal assumption.'"
