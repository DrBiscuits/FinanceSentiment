  "analysis": "The main featured image shows a large metallic bear statue - a classic bearish market symbol. The headline reads 'Dark side of AI': Wall Street on the risk of more selling for stocks. While there are no human faces in the main photo, the deliberate choice of a bear statue combined with the alarming headline creates an unmistakably pessimistic tone about the market. Rating 2/10 reflects significant market pessimism and bearish sentiment.",
