  "analysis": "The main photo shows a man testifying (nameplate visible: 'MR. HAWLEY') with a distinctly serious and concerned facial expression. His eyebrows are slightly furrowed, conveying worry or defensiveness. His mouth is open mid-speech with a tense set, and his hand is raised in a pointing/explanatory gesture. The overall body language suggests he is addressing serious concerns or defending a position under scrutiny. The expression lacks any positive indicators - no smile, no relaxed features, no confidence.",
